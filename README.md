Health insurance is one of the most marketed products offered by leading insurance firms. The bottom line in this industry is driven by the simple fact that the capital spent by the insurance company in response to beneficiary claims should not exceed customer premium. Higher the difference between settled claims and total premium received, higher are the profits.   

This predictive model seeks to achieve the following objectives:   

1. **Analyze client profile:**   
Help an insurance company factor in interaction between different features like age, BMI, smoking habits in order to predict the insurance premium charges for new customers and adjust those of existing customers.   
2. **Predict insurance premium:**     
Prevent the insurer from under-charging a risk prone individual and thus maximize the profits by charging them appropriately.   
3. **Win-win for both:- Insurer & Beneficiary:**    
Help the prospective insurance beneficiaries understand the factors that could lower their insurance premium.   

The modelling and analysis is structured as follows:   
1. Importing the dataset   
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)   
3. Training the model   
4. Intrepreting the results   
5. Improvements in the model   
6. Summarize practical insights from the analysis
